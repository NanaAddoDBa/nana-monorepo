# Backend API Contract

This document defines the initial Backend V1 HTTP API. All user-owned routes require authentication and must scope reads/writes by the authenticated `userId`.

## Shared Rules

- Auth is required unless the endpoint is explicitly part of register/login.
- Do not accept `userId` from client request bodies for ownership.
- Every user-owned query must use authenticated `userId`.
- Request validation happens server-side.
- Responses must not include password hashes, session secrets, provider tokens, or internal encryption metadata.
- Authentication uses an opaque random token in the HttpOnly `exp_tracker_session` cookie.
- Only the SHA-256 session token hash is stored in PostgreSQL.
- The raw session token is never returned in JSON or stored in frontend `localStorage`.
- Money values use integer minor units, such as `amountMinor: 1250` for EUR 12.50.
- Backend V1 supports EUR as the default currency.

## Shared Domain Values

```ts
type EntrySource = "manual" | "receipt_scan" | "connected_account" | "recurring_forecast";
type PaymentMethod = "cash" | "debit_card" | "credit_card" | "digital_wallet" | "bank_transfer";
type AccountType = "checking" | "savings" | "credit_card" | "digital_wallet";
```

Backend V1 should create manual expenses first, while keeping `entrySource`, `paymentMethod`, `sourceAccountId`, `receiptId`, `importBatchId`, and `externalTransactionId` available in the model for future receipt/import flows.

## Error Shape

Error shape:

```ts
type ApiErrorResponse = {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: unknown;
    requestId?: string;
    timestamp: string;
  };
};
```

Likely shared errors:

- `401 UNAUTHORIZED`
- `403 FORBIDDEN`
- `404 NOT_FOUND`
- `409 CONFLICT`
- `422 VALIDATION_ERROR`
- `429 RATE_LIMITED`
- `500 INTERNAL_ERROR`

## Auth

### POST /auth/register

Purpose: create a user account and start a session.

Auth: not required.

Request:

```ts
type RegisterRequest = {
  name?: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
};
```

Response:

```ts
type RegisterResponse = {
  data: {
    user: AuthUserResponse;
  };
};
```

Validation notes:

- Name is optional and limited to 100 characters.
- Email must be valid and unique.
- Password must be 8-128 characters.
- Email is normalized to lowercase.

Ownership rule: creates a new user-owned scope.

Cookie behavior: returns `exp_tracker_session` as an HttpOnly, `SameSite=Lax` cookie. The response does not contain the raw session token.

Likely errors: `409 CONFLICT`, `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`, `429 RATE_LIMITED`.

### POST /auth/login

Purpose: authenticate a user and start a session.

Auth: not required.

Request:

```ts
type LoginRequest = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
};
```

Response:

```ts
type LoginResponse = {
  data: {
    user: AuthUserResponse;
  };
};
```

Validation notes:

- Email and password are required.
- Email is normalized to lowercase.
- Use a generic failure message for invalid credentials.
- Disabled users receive `403 FORBIDDEN`.

Ownership rule: session identifies one authenticated user.

Cookie behavior: creates a new server-side session and returns the opaque token only through the HttpOnly cookie.

Likely errors: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`, `403 FORBIDDEN`, `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`, `429 RATE_LIMITED`.

### POST /auth/logout

Purpose: end the current session.

Auth: session cookie is read when present. Logout is idempotent and clears the cookie even if the session is already absent or invalid.

Request: none.

Response:

```ts
type LogoutResponse = {
  data: {
    success: true;
  };
};
```

Validation notes: none.

Ownership rule: only the current user's session is ended.

Likely errors: none for an absent session; unexpected infrastructure failures use the shared error convention.

### GET /auth/me

Purpose: return the authenticated user.

Auth: required.

Request: none.

Response:

```ts
type MeResponse = {
  data: {
    user: AuthUserResponse;
  };
};
```

Validation notes: none.

Ownership rule: returns only the current user.

Likely errors: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

### Auth user response

```ts
type AuthUserResponse = {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string | null;
  status: "ACTIVE" | "DISABLED" | "PENDING_VERIFICATION";
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

The response never includes `passwordHash`, session token hashes, verification internals, or session secrets.

### Session behavior

- Session tokens are generated from 32 cryptographically random bytes.
- Only a SHA-256 token hash is stored in the `Session` table.
- Sessions expire after `SESSION_TTL_DAYS`, defaulting to seven days.
- Logout records `revokedAt` for the matching session.
- `AuthGuard` rejects missing, expired, revoked, or unknown sessions.
- OAuth, social sign-in, refresh tokens, password reset, and email verification workflows are not part of this phase.

## Users/Profile

### GET /me

Purpose: return the current user's profile.

Auth: required.

Request: none.

Response:

```ts
type UserResponse = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

Validation notes: none.

Ownership rule: returns only authenticated user's profile.

Likely errors: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`.

### PATCH /me

Purpose: update profile fields.

Auth: required.

Request:

```ts
type UpdateProfileRequest = {
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
};
```

Response:

```ts
type UpdateProfileResponse = {
  user: UserResponse;
};
```

Validation notes:

- Name cannot be empty when provided.
- Email must be valid and unique when provided.

Ownership rule: updates only authenticated user's profile.

Likely errors: `401 UNAUTHORIZED`, `409 CONFLICT`, `422 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
