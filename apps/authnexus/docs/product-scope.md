# Product Boundary

AuthNexus exists so consuming applications do not each invent registration, credentials, external
provider handling, recovery, and session security. A consumer should eventually supply an
application profile—allowed redirects, branding, registration fields, enabled methods, and policy—
while AuthNexus owns the security-sensitive workflow.

## In this repository

- The reusable browser experience in `apps/web`.
- The public HTTP boundary in `apps/api`.
- Identity, authentication, session, recovery, policy, audit, notification, and provider code under
  `src/backend` as those modules are added.
- Local dependency and future deployment definitions under `infra` and `compose.yaml`.
- Product decisions and release evidence under `docs`.

## Outside this repository

- A consuming product's business authorization model and application pages.
- A custom OAuth authorization server or general-purpose identity-provider product.
- Frontend-owned method eligibility, session issuance, account linking, or assurance decisions.
- Real SMS, WhatsApp, email, or federation credentials in source control.
- Development in the downstream `nana-monorepo/apps/authnexus` mirror.

## Current evidence

Through D.1, the code can build the web and API processes, start PostgreSQL, Redis, and Mailpit
locally, and construct an `ApplicationProfile` that rejects unsafe or incomplete configuration.
No running process loads or stores that profile. There is still no user record, credential,
authentication transaction, cookie, authentication endpoint, or provider callback. Later-flow
documents remain design inputs until corresponding code and tests exist.
